    "\n",
    "3) To submit HW solutions, go to our course in Canvas --> Assignments --> HW 2 --> Submit Assignment --> Click \"Chose file\" --> choose HTML file you saved --> Click another file--> choose ipynb file--submit. Once you submit, download  and check to make sure that you have submitted the correct files.\n",

    "A distribution (here it is one of the numerical columns) in which the values of mean, median, and mode coincide (i.e., mean = median = mode) is known as a normal distribution (a perfect data set).It has a bell shapped curve when plotted and is also symmetric about the mean. Conversely, when mean, median, and mode values are not equal, the distribution is known as asymmetrical or skewed distribution. In moderately skewed or asymmetrical distribution, a very important relationship exists among these three measures of central tendencies. In such distributions, the distance between the mean and median is about one-third of the mean and mode distance. Karl Pearson, a renowned statistician, expressed this relationship as:\n",

If this number is close to 0 for a column, the column data is close to being symmetric, and if it is far from 0 ( positive or negative), the column data is asymmetric. Which column is closest to being symmetric, and which one is the most asymmetric?"
