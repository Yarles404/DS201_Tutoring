    "The data set called Highway1 (used by  by Carl Hoffstedt in his paper: https://rdrr.io/rforge/alr4/man/Highway1.html) relate the automobile accident rate, in accidents per million vehicle miles to several potential terms. The data include 39 sections of large Highways in the state of Minnesota in 1973. The goal of this analysis is to see how the rate variable are affetcted by some of the variables that are highly correlated with the rate and finding out which ones affect the rate variable the most. \n",

    "Upload the Highway data in Jupyter notebook. This data came from the R package, which uses index starting at 1, unlike in python, where indices begin at 0. When you upload highway1 data to the jupyter notebook, you will see an unnecessary column that says column 0. Remove it and find the correlation matrix of the remaining columns. In this data, the \"rate\" is the dependent variable. Find and report two variables with the highest positive correlation and the highest negative correlation with the variable \"rate.\" Call these two variables $x$ and $z$, respectively. Make sure to avoid correlation with itself."
